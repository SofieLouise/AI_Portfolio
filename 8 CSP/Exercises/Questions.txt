1. What is returned by create_australia_csp()?
    Returns a CSP object with information about Australia.
    return CSP(variables, domains, neighbours, constraints)

2. What is returned by backtracking_search()?
    return self.recursive_backtracking({})
    When self.isComplete it returns the complete assignment.

3. What is the purpose of assignment variable?
    It holds information about the variables currently assigned.

4. What is the purpose of variable variable?
    It holds a reference to the next variable which not in the assignment.

5. What is the purpose of the following statement?
    for value in self.order_domain_values(variable, assignment)
    It returns all possible domain values for the variable.
    For example. ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green'] for a state.

6. What would the following do?
    if self.is_consistent(var, value, {'Q': 'Red', 'NT': 'Blue', 'NSW': 'green'}):
        assignment[variable] = value

    It would assume that Q, NT and NSW are already assigned. Var is the first unassigned variable, which is 'WA'.
    Value is the first color which is 'Red'. If this is consistent it would add or update the key 'WA' and the value 'Red'

7. What would then assignment be?
    {'WA': 'Red'}

8. What is the effect of del assignment[variable]?
    This deletes the key-value entry with the key variable.
